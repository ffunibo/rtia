<p class="giustificato">Un'accusa mossa agli USA durante il Tribunale Russell era relativa alla loro presunta volontà di commettere un genocidio in territorio vietnamita; su questo tema propose un importante contributo Sartre che nel 1968 pubblica "On Genocide", breve saggio in cui cerca di analizzare la postura politica e militare statunitense nei confronti dei civili vietnamiti. Fine ultimo di tale ricerca era stabilire se l'esercito statunitense abbia ucciso cittadini vietnamiti per il solo fatto di essere di nazionalità vietnamita.
<h3>On Genocide - Il testo</h3>
	
<p>The word ‘genocide’ has not been in existence for very long: it was 
the jurist Lemkin who coined it between the two world wars. The thing 
itself is as old as humanity and there has never been a society whose 
structure has preserved it from committing this crime. All genocide is a
 product of history and it always carries the signs of the society from 
which it springs. The case which we have to judge concerns the largest 
contemporary capitalist power. It is as such that we must attempt to 
consider it; in other words, inasmuch as it expresses the economic 
structure, the political aims and the contradictions of that power.</p><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
<p>In particular, we must try to understand whether there is an 
intention of genocide in the war that the American government is 
fighting against Vietnam. Article 2 of the Convention of 1948 defines 
genocide on the basis of intention. The Convention was tacitly referring
 to very recent history. Hitler had declared a deliberate plan to 
exterminate the Jews; he did not conceal the fact that he was using 
genocide as a political tactic. The Jew had to be put to death, wherever
 he came from, not because he had taken up arms or had joined a 
resistance movement, but just because he was a Jew. The American 
government, on the other hand, has made no such clear declarations. It 
even averred that it was going to the rescue of its allies, the South 
Vietnamese, who had been attacked by the Communists from the North. Is 
it possible for us, in objectively studying the facts, to unveil their 
hidden intention? And can we, after this examination, say that the armed
 forces of the USA are killing Vietnamese in Vietnam for the simple 
reason that they are Vietnamese?</p>
<p>This can only be established after a look at history: the structures 
of war change at the same time as those of society. From 1860 to this 
day, military motives and objectives have undergone a profound change 
and the end result of this metamorphosis is precisely the war of 
‘example’ that the USA is waging in Vietnam.</p>
<p>1856: Treaties for the preservation of the property of neutrals;<br>
1864: At Geneva, an attempt to protect the wounded;<br>
1899, 1907: At The Hague, two Conferences attempting to control conflicts.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence if jurists and governments have multiplied 
agreements to ‘humanize war’ on the eve of two of the most horrifying 
massacres that man has ever known. Vladimir Dedijer has shown very well 
in his book On Military Conventions that capitalist societies were all 
simultaneously creating this monster, total war, which expresses their 
real nature. This is because:</p>
<p>1. Competition between the industrialized nations fighting over new 
markets engenders a permanent hostility which is expressed, both in 
theory and in practice, by what is called ‘bourgeois nationalism’.</p>
<p>2. The development of industry, which is the source of these 
antagonisms, enables them to be resolved at the expense of one 
competitor, in the production of more and more massively lethal arms. 
The result of this evolution is that it becomes less and less possible 
to distinguish the rear from the front line, between the civilian 
population and the soldiers.</p>
<p>3. More military objectives appear, near to the cities. The 
factories, even if they are not working for the armies, do comprise the 
economic potential of a country. Therefore, the destruction of this 
potential becomes the aim of the war and the means by which it may be 
won.</p>
<p>4. For this reason, everybody is mobilized: the peasant fights at the
 front, the labourer is a soldier in the second line, the wives of the 
peasants replace the men in the fields. In the total effort of one 
country against another, the worker tends to become a fighter because, 
in the end, it is the strongest economic power that has the greatest 
chance of winning.</p>
<p>5. Finally, the democratic evolution of the bourgeois countries 
interests the masses in politics. The masses do not control the 
decisions of the state, but gradually gain a self-awareness. When a war 
comes, they no longer feel detached. Thus, reappraised and often 
deformed by propaganda, war becomes an ethical decision of the whole 
community. In every nation engaged in war manipulation makes all, 
or nearly all, the citizens the enemies of the other nation. In this way
 war becomes total.</p>
<p>6. These same technologically advanced societies do not cease to 
enlarge upon the field of competition in multiplying the means of 
communication. The well-known ‘One World’ of the Americans already 
existed at the end of the nineteenth century when the wheat from 
Argentina managed to ruin the farmers in Britain. War is total not only 
because all the members of one community are at war against the members 
of another, but because its risk embraces the whole world.</p>
<p>Therefore the war of bourgeois nations – of which the conflict of 
1914 is the first example, but which had been menacing Europe since 1900
 – is not the invention of one man or one government, but the simple 
necessity since the beginning of the century for a totalitarian effort 
against those who wish to carry on their politics by other means or 
methods. In other words, the option is clear; no war or total war. It 
was total war that our fathers fought. And the governments – who could 
see it coming but did not have the intelligence or the courage to avoid 
it – tried vainly to humanize it.</p>
<p>However, in the First World War, intentions of genocide only appeared
 sporadically. The primary aim – as in the two centuries previously – 
was to destroy the military strength of a country, even if the more 
profound aim was to ruin its economy. But, although it was sometimes 
difficult to distinguish the civilians from the soldiers, it was rare, 
except during a few terroristic raids, for the population itself to be a
 target. Further, the two sides were developed nations, which implied 
from the outset a certain balance inasmuch as each side had a sufficient
 deterrent against the threat of extermination: the possibility for 
retaliation. This explains how, even in the midst of the massacre, a 
certain caution was observed.</p>
<p>However, since 1830 and throughout the last century, there have been 
many genocides outside Europe, some of which were the expression of 
authoritarian political structures, while the others – those which we 
need to know about to understand the growth of US imperialism and the 
nature of the war in Vietnam – found their origin in capitalistic 
democracies. To export goods and capital, the big powers, and in 
particular Great Britain and France, built themselves colonial empires. 
The name by which the French called their conquests – ‘overseas 
possessions’ – clearly indicates that they could only have acquired them
 by wars of aggression, seeking out the foe in his own country, in 
Africa, in Asia and in the underdeveloped lands. Far from being ‘total 
wars’, which would indicate a certain initial reciprocity, such complete
 superiority of arms only required an Expeditionary Force. This easily 
conquered any regular armies that existed, but because such barefaced 
aggression provoked the hatred of the civilian populations, which is the
 reserve of manpower or soldiers, the colonial troops imposed themselves
 by the terror of constant massacres. These massacres had all the 
characteristics of genocide: they involved destruction of ‘one part of 
the group’ (ethnic, national, religious) to terrorize the rest and break
 down the indigenous social structure. When the French had made a 
bloodbath of Algeria during the last century, they imposed on this 
tribal society – where every community possessed its own indivisible 
lands – the Code Civile, which consists of bourgeois jurisdiction with 
regard to the division of inherited property. Thus, they systematically 
destroyed the economic structure of the country. The land soon passed 
from the peasant tribes into the hands of merchants who had come from 
France. In fact, colonialization is not just a simple conquest – as was 
the case in 1870 when Germany annexed Alsace-Lorraine – it is 
necessarily a cultural genocide. One cannot colonize without 
systematically destroying the particular character of the natives, at 
the same time denying them the right of integration with the mother 
country and of benefiting from its advantages. Colonialism is, in 
effect, a system: the colony sells raw materials and foodstuffs at a 
favourable price to the colonial power which then sells industrial goods
 back to them at world market prices. This peculiar method of exchange 
can only be established when the native labour is made to work for 
starvation wages. It naturally follows that the colonized lose their 
national personality, their culture, their customs, sometimes even their
 language, and live in misery like shadows constantly reminded of their 
own sub-humanity.</p>
<p>Yet their value as virtually free labour protects them to a certain 
extent from genocide. The Nuremberg Tribunal was fresh in the memory 
when the French, to make an example, massacred 45,000 Algerians at 
Sétif. This was such a common occurrence that no one then thought 
of judging the French government as the Nazis had been judged. But this 
deliberate destruction of ‘one part of the national group’ could not be 
continued without proving to the disadvantage of the settlers. To have 
done so would have ruined them. It is because they were unable to 
liquidate the Algerian population, and because they did not integrate 
the country, that the French lost the war in Algeria.</p>
<p>These comments enable us to understand how the nature of colonial 
wars was transformed after the Second World War. It is at about this 
period, in fact, that the people in the colonies, enlightened by such 
conflict and its impact on the ‘empires’, and encouraged by Mao 
Tse-tung’s victory, determined to regain their national independence.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the struggle were clear from the beginning: 
the settlers were superior in arms, the colonized in numbers. Even in 
Algeria – a colony of settlers rather than of outside exploitation – the
 ratio of settlers to natives was 1:9. During the two world wars, many 
native peoples had learned the military arts and become well-seasoned 
soldiers. However, the scarcity and quality of weapons – at least at the
 beginning – limited the number of fighting units. These conditions 
dictated the nature of the fighting: terrorism, ambush, harassing the 
enemy, and the extreme mobility of the combat groups which had to strike
 unexpectedly and disappear immediately. This was not possible without 
the participation of the entire population. Hence the well-known. 
association of the forces of liberation with the masses: the former 
organizing agrarian reform, political bodies and education; the latter 
supporting, feeding and hiding the liberation army’s soldiers, and 
giving them their young to replace their losses.</p>
<p>It is not by mere chance that the ‘popular’ war, with its principles,
 its strategy, its tactics and its theoreticians, begins at the same 
time as the industrial powers brought total war to its ultimate stage 
with the harnessing of nuclear fission. Nor is it by chance that it 
resulted in the ruin of colonialism. The contradiction that gave victory
 to the FLN in Algeria was typical of the time; in fact, popular war 
eradicates classical war (as does the hydrogen bomb).</p>
<p>Against partisans backed by the entire population, colonial armies 
are helpless. They have only one way of escaping from the 
harassment which demoralizes them and tends towards a Dien Bien Phu. 
This is to eliminate the civilian population. As it is the unity of a 
whole people that is containing the conventional army, the only 
anti-guerrilla strategy which will be effective is the destruction of 
that people, in other words, the civilians, women and children.</p>
<p>Torture and genocide were the colonialists’ answers to the uprising 
of the natives. And that answer, as we know, is useless if it is not 
definitive and total. A determined population, unified by its fierce and
 politicized partisan army, will not let itself be intimidated, as it 
was in the heyday of colonialism, by a massacre ‘as a lesson’. On the 
contrary, this will only increase its hatred. It is no longer a matter 
of arousing fear but of physically liquidating a people. And as this is 
not possible without at the same time eliminating the colonial economy 
and the colonial system; the settlers panic, the colonial powers grow 
tired of sinking manpower and money into a conflict with no solution, 
the masses at home end up opposing the continuation of barbaric wars and
 the colonies become independent states.</p>
<p>There do exist, however, cases where the genocidal solution to 
popular wars is not held back by innate contradictions. Total genocide 
then reveals itself as the foundation of anti-guerrilla strategy. And, 
under certain circumstances, it would even present itself as the 
ultimate objective, either immediately or gradually. This is exactly 
what has happened in the war in Vietnam. This is a new aspect of the 
imperialist process, one usually called neocolonialism because it is 
defined as aggression against an old colonial country, which has already
 attained its independence, to subject it once again to colonial rule. 
At first, the neo-colonialists make sure – either by the financing of a 
putsch or by another underhand stroke – that the new rulers will not 
represent the interest of the masses but that of a small minority of the
 privileged classes and, thus, that of foreign capital. In Vietnam this 
took the form of Diem, imposed, maintained and armed by the US, and of 
the proclaimed decision to reject the Treaty of Geneva and to constitute
 the Vietnamese territory south of the 17th parallel as an independent 
state. The natural results of this were a police force and an army to 
hunt those who, frustrated in their victory, immediately and even before
 any effective resistance movement, declared themselves to be the 
enemies of the new government. It was the reign of terror that provoked a
 new uprising in the South and re-ignited the popular war. Did the US 
ever think that Diem would quash the revolt at its outset? In any event,
 they did not delay in sending experts, then troops, until they were up 
to their necks in the conflict. And gradually we can retrace almost 
exactly the same war that Ho Chi Minh waged against the French, even 
though the American government declared at the beginning that they were 
sending their troops out of generosity and out of duty to an ally.</p>
<p>This is how it appears. But, fundamentally, these two successive 
conflicts do have a different nature: the United States, unlike the 
French, do not have any economic interests in Vietnam. A few private 
American companies have invested there, but they are not so large that 
they could not, if necessary, be sacrificed without really affecting the
 American economy or harming the monopolies. Because the US is not 
pursuing the war for direct economic reasons, it need not rule out 
putting an end to it by the ultimate strategy of genocide. This does not
 prove that America has thought of this solution, only that nothing bars
 it from such a strategy.</p>
<p>In fact, according to the Americans themselves, the war has two 
objectives. Recently, Dean Rusk declared: ‘We are defending ourselves.’ 
It is no longer Diem, the ally in danger, or Ky that they have come to 
rescue. It is the United States that is in danger in Saigon. This means 
that their first aim is military: it is to encircle Communist China, the
 major obstacle to their expansionism. Thus, they will not let 
south-east Asia escape. America has put men in power in Thailand, it 
controls part of Laos and threatens to invade Cambodia. But these 
conquests will be useless if the US has to face a free Vietnam with 
thirty-one million united people. That is why the military chiefs often 
talk of ‘key positions’. That is why Dean Rusk says, with unconscious 
humour, that the armed forces of the United States are fighting in 
Vietnam ‘to avoid a Third World War’. Either this phrase makes no sense 
at all, or it must be understood to mean ‘to win a Third World War’. In 
short, the first objective is governed by the necessity of establishing a
 Pacific Defence Line, which can only be imposed in the general 
political framework of imperialism. </p>
<p>The second objective is economic. General Westmoreland defined it in 
these terms in October 1966: ‘We are making war in Vietnam to show that 
guerrilla warfare does not pay.’ To show whom? The Vietnamese? That 
would be very surprising. Is it necessary to spend so many human lives 
and so much money to convince a nation of poor peasants struggling 
thousands of miles from San Francisco? And, above all, what need was 
there to attack, to provoke to battle and then crush it so as to show 
the uselessness of the fight, when the interests of the large companies 
are so negligible? Westmoreland’s phrase – like that of Rusk quoted 
above – needs to be completed. It is to the others that they want to 
prove that guerrilla warfare does not pay: all the exploited and 
oppressed nations who may be tempted to free themselves from the Yankee 
yoke with a war for freedom, first of all against their own 
pseudo-governments and the compradores supported by a national army, 
then against the ‘Special Forces’ of the United States and finally 
against the GIs. In other words, it is an example for Latin America and 
the entire underdeveloped world. To Guevara, who used to say: ‘We need 
many Vietnams’, the American government replies: ‘They will all be 
crushed as we are crushing this one.’</p>
<p>In other words, this war is primarily a warning for three, and 
perhaps four, continents. After all, Greece is also a peasant nation and
 a dictatorship has just been established there. It is best to warn: 
submission or complete liquidation. So, this exemplary genocide is a 
warning to all humanity. It is with this warning that six per cent of 
mankind hope, without too much expense, to control the remaining 
ninety-four per cent.</p>
<p>At this point in our discussion, three facts emerge: (1) the US 
government wants a base and an example; (2) this can be achieved, 
without any greater obstacle than the resistance of the Vietnamese 
people themselves, by liquidating an entire people and establishing a 
Pax Americana on a Vietnamese desert; (3) to attain the second, the US 
must achieve, at least partially, this extermination.</p>
<p>The declarations of American statesmen are not as frank as those that
 Hitler made in his day. But honesty is not indispensable; the facts 
speak for themselves. The speeches that accompany them, ad usum 
internum, will only be believed by the American people; the rest 
of the world understands only too well. Friendly governments keep 
silent. The others denounce the genocide, but the Americans reply to 
them that they are showing which side they are really on by their 
unproven accusations. In fact, say the American government. we have done
 nothing but offer the Vietnamese – North and South – this choice: 
either you stop your aggression or we break you. There is no longer any 
need to point out that this proposition is absurd since the aggression 
is American, so that only the Americans themselves can put an end to it.
 But this absurdity is not uncalculated: it is clever to formulate a 
demand which the Vietnamese cannot possibly satisfy. In this way, 
America remains the master of the decision to stop the fighting. But, 
one might read the alternatives as: declare yourselves conquered, or ‘we
 will take you back to the Stone Age’. It does not cancel out the second
 term of the alternative, which is genocide. They have said: genocide, 
yes, but only conditional genocide. Is this legally valid? Is it even 
conceivable?</p>
<p>If the argument had any legal meaning, the government of the United 
States would only just escape the accusation of genocide. But, as MaîTre
 Matarasso has remarked, the law, in distinguishing between intention 
and motive, does not leave room for this escape clause. Genocide, 
especially as it has been carried on for several years, may well have 
blackmail as a motive. One may declare that one will stop if the victim 
submits. Those are the motivations and the act does not cease to be 
genocide by intention. This is particularly so when, as in this case, 
part of the group has been annihilated to force the rest to submission.</p>
<p>But let us look more closely and see what the terms of the 
alternative are. In the South, this is the choice: the villages are 
burnt, the population has to endure massive and deliberately destructive
 bombardments, the cattle are shot at, the vegetation is ruined by 
defoliants, what does grow is ruined by toxic elements, machine guns are
 aimed haphazardly, and everywhere there is killing, rape and pillage. 
That is genocide in its most rigorous meaning of massive extermination. 
What is the other choice? What must the Vietnamese people do to escape 
this atrocious death? Join the American armed forces or those of Saigon,
 or let themselves be enclosed in strategic hamlets or in those ‘new 
life’ compounds, which are two names for concentration camps.</p>
<p>We know about these camps from numerous witnesses. They are 
surrounded by barbed wire. The most elementary needs are ignored. There 
is under-nourishment and complete lack of sanitation. The prisoners are 
packed into tents or primitive huts where they stifle. The social 
structure is destroyed. Husbands are separated from wives, mothers from 
their children, family life – so respected by the Vietnamese – no longer
 exists. As the homes are broken up, the birth rate diminishes; all 
possibility of cultural or religious life is abolished. Even work that 
will improve the standard of living is denied them. These unfortunates 
are not even slaves (the servile condition of the American Negroes has 
not stifled their own deep culture); this group is reduced to the state 
of an appendage, to the worst of vegetative lives. Anyone who wants to 
escape can only make contact with other men shattered and ravaged by 
hate, who can only regroup clandestinely for political resistance. The 
enemy guesses this, so that the camps are raked over two or three times.
 Even there, security is never certain and the shattering forces are 
always at work. If by any chance a broken family, e.g. some children 
with an older sister or a young mother, are freed, they go to swell the 
proletariat in the towns. The elder sister or the young mother, without a
 breadwinner and with so many mouths to feed, sinks to the utmost 
degradation in prostitution to the enemy. This is the lot of one third 
of the population in the South, according to Mr Duncan’s evidence. It is
 the sort of genocide condemned by the Convention of 1948:</p>
<p>Grave damage to physical or mental health of members of the group;<br>
Intentional submission of the group to such conditions of existence as result in total or partial physical damage;<br>
Steps taken to prevent births within the group;<br>
Forcible removal of children…</p>
<p>In other words, it is not true that the choice lies between death or 
submission. Submission, under these circumstances, amounts to genocide. 
Let us say that there is only a choice between immediate violent death 
and a slow death after mental and physical de gradation.</p>
<p>Is it any different in the North?</p>
<p>One choice is extermination: not only the daily risk of death 
but also the systematic destruction of the economic system, from the 
irrigation ditches to the factories of which ‘there must not be a brick 
left upon another brick’; deliberate attacks on the civilian population,
 and in particular on the countryside; destruction of hospitals, 
schools, places of worship, consistent effort towards wiping out the 
achievements of twenty years of Socialism. Is this simply to terrorize 
the population? That can only be achieved by the daily extermination of 
an ever larger number of the group. This terrorism itself, in its 
psycho-social consequences, is genocide. Who knows if, with the children
 in particular, this will not result in mental disturbances which will 
affect them permanently?</p>
<p>The other choice is capitulation. This would mean acceptance from the
 North Vietnamese that their country should be divided in two and that 
the American dictatorship, either directly or through their puppets, 
should be imposed on their compatriots and on the members of their own 
families from whom the war has separated them. Would this intolerable 
humiliation put an end to the war? This is far from certain: the NLF and
 the DRV, although united, have different strategies and tactics because
 of their different stances in the war. If the NLF continued the 
struggle, American bombers would carry on, even if the DRV capitulated.</p>
<p>But should the war come to an end, we know – from official 
declarations – that the United States would be generously inclined to 
rebuild the DRV with mountains of dollars. This would mean that they 
would destroy, with their private investments or conditional loans, all 
the economic basis of socialism. That, too, is genocide: the cutting in 
two of a sovereign state; occupying one half with a reign of terror, 
effectively ruining the enterprise so dearly paid for by the other half 
with economic pressures and with calculated investments, to be held in a
 tight stranglehold. The national unit of ‘Vietnam’ would not be 
physically eliminated, but it would no longer exist economically, 
politically or culturally.</p>
<p>In the North, as in the South, there is a choice between two types of
 destruction: collective death or disintegration. Most significant is 
the fact that the American government has felt the measure of NLF and 
DRV resistance: it knows now that only total destruction will be 
effective. The Front is more powerful than ever; North Vietnam is 
resolute. For this very reason, the calculated extermination of the 
Vietnamese people can only be intended to make them capitulate. The 
Americans offer them peace knowing that it wilt not be accepted. This 
spurious alternative hides the real imperialist intention, which is a 
gradual progress towards the ultimate escalation of total genocide.</p>
<p>The United States government could have achieved this immediately by a
 Vietnamese Blitzkrieg. But, apart from the fact that this extermination
 would have involved complicated preparations – for example, the 
construction and unrestricted use of air bases in Thailand, shortening 
the bombers’ journey by 5,000 kilometres – the essential aim of the 
‘escalation’ was and still is, to this day, to prepare bourgeois opinion
 for genocide. From this point of view, the Americans have succeeded 
only too well. The repeated and systematic bombing of the densely 
populated areas of Haiphong and Hanoi, which two years ago would have 
given rise to violent protests, is carried on today in a sort of general
 indifference which is more like gangrene than apathy. The trick has 
worked: public opinion accepts a constant and imperceptible increase of 
pressure which is preparing their minds for the final genocide. Is this 
genocide possible? No. But only because of the Vietnamese, their courage
 and the admirable efficiency of their organizations. As for the US 
government, nobody can excuse their crime just because the intelligence 
and heroism of their victims limits its effects.</p>
<p>One can conclude that, in a ‘popular’ war (that product of our times,
 the answer to imperialist aggression and the claim to sovereignty of a 
people conscious of its own unity) only two attitudes are possible: 
either the aggressor gives way, makes peace and recognizes that a whole 
nation is opposing him; or else, realizing the ineffectiveness of 
classical strategy, if he can do so without damaging his own interests, 
he resorts to extermination pure and simple. There is no other choice; 
but, this choice, at least, is always possible.</p>
<p>While the armed forces of the USA are digging deeper into Vietnam, 
intensifying the massacres and bombings attempting to subject Laos and 
intending to invade Cambodia, there is no doubt that the government of 
the United States, despite all the hypocritical denials, has opted for 
genocide.</p>
<p>The intention is obvious from the facts. And, as M. Aybar said, it 
can only be premeditated. It is possible that in the past genocide was 
committed suddenly, in a flash of passion, in the midst of tribal or 
feudal conflicts. Anti-guerrilla genocide, however, is a product of our 
times that necessarily entails organization, bases and, therefore, 
accomplices (from a distance) and the appropriate budget. It needs to be
 thought over and planned. Does this mean that those responsible are 
fully aware of their own intentions? It is difficult to decide: to do so
 one would have to probe the latent ill-will of puritanical motives.</p>
<p>Maybe some people in the State Department are so used to lying that 
they still manage to believe that they only want the best for Vietnam. 
But, after the most recent declarations of their spokesmen, one can 
presume that there are fewer of these innocents. ‘We are defending 
ourselves: even if the Saigon government asked us to, we would not leave
 Vietnam’, etc. In any case, we do not have to worry about this 
psychological hide-and-seek. The truth is to be found on the field, in 
the racialism of the American troops. Naturally, this racialism – 
anti-black, anti-Asiatic, anti-Mexican – is a fundamental characteristic
 which has deep-rooted origins and which existed, latent or apparent, 
long before the Vietnam war. The proof lies in the United States 
government’s refusal to ratify the Geneva Convention on genocide. This 
does not mean that ever since 1948 the Americans have intended to 
exterminate whole peoples but that, according to their own declaration, 
the Convention would have conflicted with the internal legislation of 
many of the American States. In other words, the present leaders 
consider themselves unshackled in Vietnam today thanks to their 
predecessors who had wanted to respect the anti-Negro racialism of the 
South. In any case, ever since 1965, the racialism of the Yankee 
soldiers from Saigon to the 17th parallel has increased. The young 
Americans torture without repugnance, shooting at unarmed women for the 
pleasure of completing a hat-trick: they kick the wounded Vietnamese in 
the testicles; they cut off the ears of the dead for trophies. The 
officers are worst: a general was boasting in front of a Frenchman who 
testified at the Tribunal of hunting the VC from his helicopter and 
shooting them down in the rice fields. They were, of course, not NLF 
fighters, who know how to protect themselves, but peasants working in 
their rice fields. In these confused American minds the Viet Cong 
and the Vietnamese tend to become more and more indistinguishable. A 
common saying is ‘The only good Vietnamese is a dead one’, or, what 
comes to the same thing, ‘Every dead Vietnamese is a Viet Cong.’</p>
<p>The peasants get ready to harvest the rice south of the 17th 
parallel. American soldiers come and burn their houses and want to 
transfer them to a strategic hamlet. The peasants protest. What else can
 they do bare-handed against these Martians? They say ‘The rice is so 
good; we would like to stay to eat our rice.’ No more, but that is 
enough to exasperate the young Americans: ‘It is the Viet Cong who have 
put this into your heads. It is they who have taught you to resist.’ 
These soldiers are so muddled that they consider as ‘subversive’ 
violence the feeble protests that their own violence has provoked. 
Originally, they were probably disappointed: they came to save Vietnam 
from Communist aggressors. They soon saw that the Vietnamese actually 
disliked them. Instead of the attractive role of the liberator they 
found themselves the occupiers. It was the beginning of self-appraisal: 
‘They do not want us, we have no business here.’ But their protest goes 
no further: they become angry and simply tell themselves that a 
Vietnamese is, by definition, a suspect.</p>
<p>There is not a single Vietnamese who is not really a Communist: the 
proof is their hatred of the Yankees. Here, in the shadowy and 
robot-like souls of the soldiers, we find the truth about the war in 
Vietnam: it matches all of Hitler’s declarations. He killed the Jews 
because they were Jews. The armed forces of the United States torture 
and kill men, women and children in Vietnam because they are Vietnamese.
 Whatever the lies or nervous hedging of the government, the spirit of 
genocide is in the soldiers’ minds. This is their way of enduring the 
genocidal situation in which their government has put them. The witness 
Peter Martinsen, a young student of twenty-three who had ‘interrogated’ 
prisoners for six months and could not bear his memories, told us: ‘I am
 an average American, I am like any other student, and here I am a war 
criminal.’ And he was right to add: ‘Anyone in my place would have acted
 as I did.’</p>
<p>His only error was to attribute these degrading crimes to the 
influence of war in general. No: it is not war in the abstract, but war waged by the largest power against a people of poor peasants, 
and war lived by those who wage it as the only possible relationship 
between an overdeveloped nation and an underdeveloped one, that is to 
say genocide expressed through racialism. The only possible 
relationship, apart from stopping short and leaving.</p>
<p>Total war implies a certain equilibrium of strength, a certain 
reciprocity. The colonial wars were waged without reciprocity, but 
colonial interests limited genocide. This present genocide, the latest 
development of the unequal progress of societies, is total war waged to 
the end by one side and with not one particle of reciprocity.</p>
<p>The American government is not guilty of having invented modern 
genocide, nor even of having chosen it from other possible answers to 
the guerrilla. It is not guilty – for example – of having preferred it 
on the grounds of strategy or economy. In effect, genocide presents 
itself as the only possible reaction to the insurrection of a whole 
people against its oppressors. The American government is guilty of 
having preferred a policy of war and aggression aimed at total genocide 
to a policy of peace, the only other alternative, because it would have 
implied a necessary reconsideration of the principal objectives imposed 
by the big imperialist companies by means of pressure groups. America is
 guilty of following through and intensifying the war, although each of 
its leaders daily understands even better, from the reports of the 
military chiefs, that the only way to win is to rid Vietnam of all the 
Vietnamese.</p>
<p>It is guilty of being deceitful, evasive, of lying, and lying to 
itself, embroiling itself every minute a little more, despite the 
lessons that this unique and unbearable experience has taught, on a path
 along which there can be no return. It is guilty, by its own admission,
 of knowingly conducting this war of ‘example’ to make genocide a 
challenge and a threat to all peoples. When a peasant dies in his rice 
field, cut down by a machine-gun, we are all hit. Therefore, the 
Vietnamese are fighting for all men and the American forces are fighting
 all of us. Not just in theory or in the abstract. And not only because 
genocide is a crime universally condemned by the rights of man. But 
because, little by little, this genocidal blackmail is spreading to all 
humanity, adding to the blackmail of atomic war. This crime is 
perpetrated under our eyes every day, making accomplices out of 
those who do not denounce it.</p>
<p>In this context, the imperialist genocide can become more serious. 
For the group that the Americans are trying to destroy by means of the 
Vietnamese nation is the whole of humanity.</p>
